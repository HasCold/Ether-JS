The ether.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its eco-system.

- It connnects the Frontend(means outer world) with the blockchain world. Will act as a bridge for communicating both layers.

------------------------------ Common Terminologies --------------------------

Provider :- A Provider (in ethers) is a class which provides an abstraction for a connection to the ethereum netwrok. It provides read-only access to the Blockchain and its status.

Signer :- A Signer is a class which (usually) in some way directly or indirectly has access to  a private key, which can sign messages and transactions to authorize the netwrok to charge your account ether to perform operations.

Contract :- A Contract is an abstraction which represents a connection to a specific contract on the Ethereum netwrok, so that applications can use it like a normal JavaScript object.
